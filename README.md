## About

Clash of Colonies is a web based RPG game where you can join forces with other players, striving to gather as many resources as possible and make your way up the global leaderboard!

## Tech Stack

The frontend is built using React written in TypeScript. The backend is written in Python using the FastAPI library. Data is stored using MongoDB. For more information, please refer to [backend](/backend/) and [frontend](/frontend/) folders respectively.

## Running

To run first clone the repository. Then inside the root directory run
```bash
npm i
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
npm start
```
You should now see the frontend running on port `3000` and the backend on port `8000`.
