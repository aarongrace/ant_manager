# Clash of Colonies

## Executive Summary

Ants are fascinating species with a complex social organization. A simulation game featuring ant colonies can be both entertaining and educational in terms of sociological behaviors and biology.

---

## Problem Overview

- How to effectively simulate a colony of ants?
- How to create a web-based solution that allows users to have their own colonies, join clans, trade resources, and send messages?
- How to store data securely and ensure consistency of game data across different play sessions?

---

## Proposed Solution

A web application using **React** for the frontend. User inputs will be sent to the backend, powered by **FastAPI**, and data will be stored securely in **MongoDB**.

---

## Scope of Work

This project seeks to simulate a colony of ants in terms of reproduction, resource gathering, and colony expansion.

# Descriptions and Implementations of Major Systems

## Core Game

### Canvas

The entire visual output of Clash of Colonies is rendered onto a HTML5 `<canvas>` element. To ensure a clean and maintainable architecture, we've implemented a separation of concerns:

* **`GameCanvas` (Conceptual Parent):** displays the game elements

* **Base `Canvas` Component (React):** manages the underlying HTML `<canvas>` element and the fundamental rendering and update loop

**Time Management and Animation Loop:**

The `Canvas` component meticulously tracks the passage of time using React refs (`lastFrameTime`). This reference is updated in each frame of the animation.

* **Efficient Animation:** `requestAnimationFrame` is used for the animation loop. This browser API synchronizes rendering with the browser's refresh rate (typically 60fps), leading to fluid visuals. Critically, it **pauses automatically** when the browser tab or window is not active, significantly reducing CPU and battery consumption.


**Browser Background Optimization:**

A key benefit of `requestAnimationFrame` is its inherent efficiency. Modern browsers are designed to automatically pause or significantly throttle the execution of `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks when the tab or window is not in focus. This dramatically reduces CPU and battery usage when the game is running in the background.

**`animate` Function:**

1.  **Time Tracking:** It calculates the elapsed time (`delta`) since the last frame
2.  **Drawing Game Elements:** calls draw provided by `GameCanvas`
3.  **Updating Game State:** calls update functions based on `delta` and intervals timers

**`continuousUpdate`**
- **`handleScrolling(delta)`:** Adjusts the visible map area based on user scroll input and speed, respecting map boundaries.
- **`updateAnt(delta)`:** Changes ant positions and animations over time; updates enemy behaviors.

**`discreteUpdate`**
- Runs at a set interval to update:
  - Ant tasks and logic.
  - Enemy behaviors.
  - Colony resource consumption and health restoration.
  - Egg laying and colony reproduction.
  - Map entity cleanup and spawning.
  - Seasonal changes and colony age progression.
  - Game-over conditions if all ants are dead.

**`synchronization`**

  Periodically updates the colony state to the backend if the time since the last sync exceeds `vars.update.syncInterval`. The `putColonyInfo` function handles the update, and `lastSyncedTime.current` prevents redundant requests.

### Map

#### Map Initialization

- **`initializeMap`**: Sets up the map by populating `GameMap.tilesGrid` with tile types based on random factors.
- Rock clusters are generated using a distance-based algorithm to ensure natural distribution. Otherwise, they would appear very uniform and unnatural

The tileset for the game.

#### Map Storage and Seasonal Adjustment

The map is stored in the database as a matrix structured as `[rows[cols[[tile_row, tile_col]]]]`. To account for seasonal variations, the season index (`0` for spring, `1` for summer, `2` for autumn, `3` for winter) is multiplied by `rowsPerSeason` and added to the `tile_row`, to get the row for the current season.
- From the matrix, the full map image data is generated by translating the tile index to tile pixels and stored in `GameMap.imageData`, which is then cropped to generate the viewport-specific map data -- `GameMap.partialImageData`.
-

#### Tile Updates

The `updateTiles` function is responsible for iterating through `GameMap.tilesGrid` and updating each tile based on specific rules:

1. **Normal Tiles**:
  - Have a chance to transform into grass.

2. **Grass Tiles**:
  - Progress through growth stages:
    - Grass (Stage 1) → Grass (Stage 2) → Grass (Stage 3).

3. **Grass (Stage 3)**:
  - Have a chance to sprout.

4. **Sprouting Tiles**:
  - Progress through their lifecycle and eventually become fruit.

- Seasonal growth and death rates influence tile transitions (e.g., grass growing or dying, sprouting fruit).

#### Seasonal Effects

- Growth and death rates for grass and sprouts are determined by `seasonalGrassGrowChances` and `seasonalGrassDeathChances`, which vary by season.
- Seasonal modifiers affect the probability of grass growth (`seasonalGrassGrowthModifiers`), with higher growth rates in spring and lower rates in winter.

### Ant Rendering and Behaviors

#### Class Definition

- **Ant Class**: Stores all crucial data for the rendering and behaviors of the ants. Also contains methods primarily relating to graphic rendering of the ants.

- **Ant Data**: Represents the raw state of an ant, used for syncing with the backend and backups. Does not include any display specific information such a angle and spriteFrame.
  - By separating frontend-specific logic from the core data, the `Ant` class ensures smooth synchronization with the backend and backups while reducing data transfer overhead by only syncing essential fields.

#### Display
- **Positioning**: The ant's position is calculated relative to the viewport, ensuring it is drawn in the correct location on the canvas.
- **Rotation**: The ant's angle is set based on its movement direction, and the canvas is rotated accordingly.
- **Sprite Animation**:
  - Different sprites are used based on the ant's type and task.
  - Each ant tracks its own sprite timer, which is updated with the animation frames of the game
  - Frame updates are managed by `updateSpriteFrame`, cycling through frames for smooth animations.
- **Task Indicators**:
  - Visual cues like patrol circles, attack arrows, or forage arrows are drawn based on the ant's current task.
- **Health Bar**: A health bar is displayed above the ant if its health is below the default value.
- **Carried Entity**: If the ant is carrying an item, it is drawn above the ant with scaling based on the item's size.
- **Selection Highlight**: A circle is drawn around the ant when it is selected, providing visual feedback to the user.

#### FastAPI Router
- Routes requests from the frontend to the backend.
- Different routers are set up for:
  - Colony information
  - User information
  - Clan information

### MongoDB Database

The database consists of four collections:

1. **User Collection**:
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `region`, `clan`, `images`, `createdDate`, `password`, `email`, `role`.

2. **Colony Collection**:
   - Fields: `id` (same as user ID), `name`, `ants`, `food`, `sand`, `age`, `map`, `perkPurchased`.

3. **Store Collection**:
   - Fields: `id`, `cosmetic or gameplay`, `associated bonus`.

4. **Clan Collection**:
   - Fields: `users` (separated into leader/officer/member), `clan score`.

---

### Tests

A series of manual tests and unit tests will be implemented for operations such as:
- Creation of users.
- Game functions such as the creation of new ants.
- Creation and deletion of clans.

## Development Notes

The conversion between camel case and snake case is NOT automatic when sending data between frontend and backend. Please only use camel case for all class fields relating to backend data such as tasks or units!!! Mismatches in field names will result in **422 Unprocessable Entity** when sending objects.

### Coordinate System

The coordinates are set up so that (1,1) is in the lower right quadrant, and (-1,-1) is in the top left quadrant, and (0,0) is in the center. It is conceived this way so to allow expansion on all sides and to accommodate for the fact that y coordinates for display and for handling inputs start from the top. 

### npm Modules

If you want to install a npm module for the frontend, you need to cd to the frontend folder and install it there with npm install .... The npm package.json and node modules in the root folder are only used for concurrently and installing packages there might confuse VSCode into thinking that certain modules are enabled for the frontend when they are not.

## Todos

### Dashboard
- add a fourth picture for fruit spawns
- add background music and sound effects
- Create sprites for ant attack.
- Make task icons hoverable. When hovered, the icons should display a range indicator or a path indicator for ants doing that task. The hover can be implemented as part of the global settings store.
- Add icons for food/debris and ant production.
- add a custom cursor display

---

## Versions

### 2.0
- The whole project has been completely refactored such that all game behavior-related functions are relegated to the backend.
- Instead of creating new units and sending them to the backend, the new approach is to have the frontend send a message to advance the time cycle to the main router, which then deals with the logic.
- This is so that Unit objects would not be passed back and forth between the frontend and the backend, which causes endless headaches with Pydantic, as the frontend class declarations do not clearly line up with those from the backend. Deserialization and serialization work extremely poorly when dealing with abstract classes and inheritance, as Pydantic requires precision.

### 3.0
- Refactored the `Colony` model:
  - The `id` field now matches the `userId` and serves as the unique identifier for colonies.
  - All fields in the `Colony` model are now camel case.
  - Added an `initialize_default` method to create a default colony with 5 ants, 100 food, and 100 sand.
- Updated the backend to reflect the changes in the `Colony` model.
- Improved consistency between frontend and backend models by enforcing camel case across all fields.
- Added new features to the **Clan View**, **Admin View**, and **Store View**.

# Known Bugs
- Refreshing the page at an unlucky time might cause put requests to the colony router to malfunction and mess up the ant array. Only happened once so far
